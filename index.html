      <p>Blood cancer is a type of sickness that affects the blood and other parts of the body that make blood, like the bone marrow and the lymphatic system. There are three main types of blood cancer: leukemia, lymphoma, and myeloma. Leukemia happens when the body makes too many white blood cells that aren't working properly, which makes it hard for the body to fight off infections. Lymphoma causes tumors to grow in the lymphatic system, which is like the body's drainage system. Myeloma starts in the bone marrow, where a special kind of cell called plasma cells grow out of control and weaken the bones.

        People with blood cancer might feel really tired, get sick a lot, lose weight without trying, have swollen glands, or bleed and bruise easily. Doctors use tests like blood tests, bone marrow biopsies, and scans to figure out what kind of blood cancer someone has and how bad it is. Treatment for blood cancer can include things like medicine, radiation, and special therapies that help the body fight off the bad cells. With the help of doctors and new treatments, many people with blood cancer can get better or learn to manage their illness, but they might need to keep seeing their doctors regularly to stay healthy.
